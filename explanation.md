# What is a module?
-A module is a place where we can store code or any type of data such as functions, runnable code, dictionaries, variables etc.
-We create modules so we don't have to type the code repeatedly.
-Modules can be uploaded online(shared) so that multiple nodes in the same workspace can use the same code (for example, game developers may need to have access to the same code for easy workflow).
-This saves time and improves readability of the code(it makes it succinct).

# What are the functions?
-We can store code in functions (which we might use later on) without running it.
-Here, each program has been saved as a function using the 'def' keyword;i.e, we are defining the program as a function.

# How does it work?
-Since we have saved each program as a function, when we create the new file, we can import only the desired function and call it to produce the desired output
-For example,
   from module1 import read_image
This imports the function read_image() from a module called 'module1'
The output will be a read and processed image (in this case, a picture of a cat)
-We put the () to indicate that we want the function to be executed
   read_image()
This indicates that we want the function to be executed.
