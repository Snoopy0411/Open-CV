# HOW TO USE
1. Download the module (module2) along with the RESOURCES (since there are extra photos uploaded here).
2. Move into a folder and open the folder in VS-Code.
3. Create a new file in the folder.
4. This is the syntax for executing a function after importing it from the module:
   # from module2 import function_name
   # function_name()
5. NOTE: the function names for each respective program is given in module_contents
6. If any error such as '-215: Assertion Failed' occurs, retype the path address which is basically the part in ('') in the following code: "img=cv.imread('*path*')"
